            <p>Want to get ORCID iDs from attendees at your next conference or event? Or maybe from everyone in your research group/lab? Share My iD makes it simple!</p>
            <ol>

                <li>Share the collection URL with people whose ORCID iDs you want to get (or display the page on a laptop/tablet at your event).</li>
                <li>Visit the collection URL to see and download iDs you've collected.</li>
            </ol>

            <p><strong>Not sure if everyone you want to get an ORCID iD from actually <em>has</em> one?</strong> No problem! Users can register for an iD and add it to your collection at the same time.</p>

            <h2>Why 'authenticated' ORCID iDs?</h2>
            <p>ORCID is all about sorting out who's who, so it's important that you get the right iD for each person. No room for typos here. Share my iD collects authenticated iDs, which means that each user's iD is sent straight from ORCID after they log into their ORCID account. You always get the correct iD for the person who logged in. <a href="https://members.orcid.org/api/tutorial/get-orcid-id">Learn more about the technical nuts and bolts of authenticated iDs</a></p>

            <h2>Want to do more with ORCID?</h2>
            <p>Share my iD was built by the fine folks at ORCID, but it's powered by APIs available to both <a href="//orcid.org/members">ORCID member organizations</a> and freely to the public. You can build your own ORCID-fuled applications. <a href="https://members.orcid.org/api/about-orcid-apis">Learn more about ORCID APIs</a></p>
